    <h1>COMPUSA <i>Live</i> </h1>
    <h2>2018</h2>
    <p>Formed as part of the experimental online channel 8Ball TV, Comp USA Live’s creators describe it as “the original live desktop theater internet television show.” Streamed episodically on a website that resembles the desktop of a Windows2000 computer, the show features segments that include surly anti-comedy standup monologues, songs performed in CGI landscapes, sudden interruptions from oddly dressed members of the studio audience, and dramatic behind-the-scenes footage of infighting among the show’s makers.</p>
    <p id="id">But Comp USA Live is more than just an unhinged remake of The Muppet Show through the use of custom software and web interfaces, it aims to rewrite the underlying relationship between viewer, performer, and computer user.</p>
